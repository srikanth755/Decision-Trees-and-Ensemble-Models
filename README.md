# Decision-Trees-and-Ensemble-Models

Use Python version == 3.9.18 and install the required libraries from requirements.txt

The dataset for this project is PCA_MNIST, which consists of total 10 classes and 10 features.

In the given notebook, firstly Decision Trees is implemented from scratch using Gini impurity and entropy. They are implemented with different depths for the Decision trees. 
Secondly, Random Forests is implemented from scratch with varying the number of trees in Random forest. 
Thirdly, AdaBoost is implemented using three different types of base classifiers.  
    -Decision Trees with max_depth = 1.  
    -SVM with linear kernel and c = 0.1.  

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Confusion matrix are used to measure the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier.
